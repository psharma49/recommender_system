# Movie-Recommender-System-in-python
Built a basic recommender system using content based filtering. Used a subset of Movie lens data set to find out what movie the system would recommend if someone has seen a movie by using correlation method based on the user rating.The data set has four features user_id, item_id,rating and timestamp. I took examples like if a person has watched Toy Story and Contact then what movies the system will recommend him next.
